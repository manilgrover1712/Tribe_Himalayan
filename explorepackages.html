					<h4 class="card-title">BIJALI MAHADEV</h4>
					<p class="card-text">BIJLI means lightning and MAHADEV is Shiva (Hindu God). In this temple of lightning, it is believed that the tall staff (60ft) attracts the lightning which falls on the temple and partially destroys the Shiv Linga inside of the temple. The priest of the temple has to restore the Shiva linga placed inside the temple using butter after every lightning as it shatters to pieces with flash of lightning.

						It is located at an altitude of about 2,500m in the Kullu Valley at about 20km from Kullu City. It can be approached by a trek of 3 km and 15-16 km journey by vehicle. The 3km trek also contains some very beautiful views. One needs to cross through thick jungle to reach the top of the mountain where the temple is situated.</p>
